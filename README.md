# Fractal Tree and Other Turtle Graphics Patterns

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that use the `turtle` module to create various graphical patterns, including fractal trees, geometric shapes, and other artistic designs. The project is developed by **Tonumoy Mukherjee**.

## Features

- **Fractal Tree Pattern**: A recursive implementation of a fractal tree with multiple colors and branches.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Includes scripts to draw squares, stars, and other geometric patterns.
- **Creative Designs**: Features unique designs like the Avengers logo, Batman logo, and more.
- **Recursive Algorithms**: Demonstrates the use of recursion to create complex patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd your-repo-name
Run any of the Python scripts using Python:

bash
Copy
python fractal_tree.py
Replace fractal_tree.py with the name of the script you want to run.

Scripts Overview
1. Fractal Tree (fractal_tree.py)
Draws a fractal tree using recursion.

The tree is drawn with multiple colors and branches, creating a visually appealing pattern.

2. Avengers Logo (avengers_logo.py)
Draws the iconic Avengers logo using turtle graphics.

Includes the outer circle, inner circle, and the 'A' with a triangle and arrow.

3. Batman Logo (batman_logo.py)
Draws the Batman logo using turtle graphics.

The logo is filled with yellow and black colors.

4. Star Pattern (star_pattern.py)
Draws a star pattern using recursion.

The star is filled with colors and can be customized in size.

5. Snowflake Pattern (snowflake.py)
Draws a snowflake pattern using recursion.

The snowflake is created by recursively drawing smaller segments.

6. Vortex of Squares (vortex_squares.py)
Draws a vortex of filled squares with random colors.

The squares decrease in size and rotate to create a vortex effect.
